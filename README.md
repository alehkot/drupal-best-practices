Drupal Website Launch Checklist
=======================

## Pre-launch ##
- Perform load testing & optimization beforehand include slow-log analyses;
- [Percona Toolkit](http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.2/pt-query-digest.html) for MySQL can help to analyze slow logs;
- Check Drupal SEO Tools report;
- Match recommendations of the following tools:
	- [Security Review Module](https://drupal.org/project/security_review);
  - [Site Audit module](https://drupal.org/project/site_audit);
  - Acquia Insight;
  - YSlow;
- Run Performance and Scalability Checklist module;
- Analyze Coder Review results;
- Perform load testing using tools with cleared database cache, memcache and image styles when caches are disabled;
- Make sure you always have a failover scenario and a quick backup;
- Configure Cron jobs;
- Disable all development modules;
- Add console.log stub;
- Configure caches and reverse-proxies properly: APC, Varnish, Memcache, Akamai;
- Make sure that AJAX requests are cached properly;
- Enable bandwidth optimization;
    - Compress cached pages;
    - Aggregate and compress JS/CSS files;
    - Use [Advanced CSS/JS Aggregation](https://drupal.org/project/advagg) module instead of core aggregation;
- Test simultaneous an consequent anonymous access scenarios and behavior when every cache is enabled;
- Replace database logging functionality with other solutions, e.g. syslog;
- Disable any errors output on frontend;
- Enable fast_404 in settings.php file or use [Fast 404](https://drupal.org/project/fast_404) module;
- [Make sure file permissions for file directories and code directory are set correctly](http://drupal.org/node/244924);
- Make sure that input formats are correctly configured;
- On /admin/config/system/site-information make sure the email address and name are correct;
- Ensure website permissions are set appropriately and minimally;
- If using SSL, change your local /etc/hosts to point the site to its live domain and ensure SSL redirection is working correctly;
- Remove test content, such as "lorum ipsum" text, dummy users, or content generated by the Devel module;
- Check the maximum file upload sizes and maximum execution time;
- If you don't use core Search module, make sure it's disabled;
- If you use any replacements for standard Cron, make sure it's disabled;
- Warm caches before launch:
    - Use [Cache Warmer module](https://drupal.org/project/cache_warmer);
    - Use [HTTPRL Spider module](https://drupal.org/project/httprl_spider);
- If possible, perform launch component-by-component and one-by-one;
- Make sure your admin account has a strong password and it's changed before launch;
- Enable caching for Views output, Panels panes output and blocks. Useful modules are the following:
    - [Views Content Cache](https://drupal.org/project/views_content_cache).

## Gotchas ##
- If you maintain a very large number of files on your website, it can have a substantial negative effect on performance and stability, especially if they are all contained in the same directory.  If your site requires a large number of files, maintain them in multiple directories;
- Using standard Views pager might cause performance issues because of additional COUNT query. Use [Views Litepager](https://drupal.org/project/views_litepager) instead.
- Some conditions prevent the use of an in-memory temporary table, in which case the server uses an on-disk table instead:
	- Presence of a BLOB or TEXT column in the table;
	- Presence of any string column in a GROUP BY or DISTINCT clause larger than 512 bytes;
	- Presence of any string column with a maximum length larger than 512 (bytes for binary strings, characters for nonbinary strings) in the SELECTlist, if UNION or UNION ALL is used.
